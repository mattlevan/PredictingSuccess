# PredictingSuccess
Implementation of data analysis and machine learning techniques for predicting the success of a company.

Description: The scope of the research project can be determined by the 
individual, but for purposes of our focused topic, key elements will be 
prescribed in that the complete data mining process needs to be followed. 
The project needs to have a clearly defined problem with resulting solution 
developed. It is expected of you to describe the process, experiments, 
selection of theoretical frameworks, and how approaches were evaluated. 

### Background
What is the key problem you’re trying to solve? Eg. Predict the performance 
of an industry or company.

  * Which data sources are you using and how reliable are these sources?
  * Have you developed an appropriate approach to addressing your key problems?
  * Who else solved these problems before?
 
### Paper Attributes
##### Project Description
Describe your project clearly with a title, sub-title and well developed 
abstract. The abstract should be a concise statement of the problem, 
questions, methodology, and conclusions from your project.

##### Introduction/Literature Review
  * What is the significance of the problem you’re addressing? Why is it worth 
  studying?
  * Are there similar projects/solutions?
  * What are the underlying theories, fundamental approaches, etc. that’s 
  worth noting?
  * Explain overall approach including data extraction, processing and 
  analysis approaches.
 
##### Problem Definition
  * What is the problem?
  * What are you hoping to find? What is the goal?
  * What are your research questions?
  * What do you want to investigate?

##### Data Selection and Acquisition:
  * What data did you use?
  * Where did the data come from?
  * How did you get the data prepared?
  * What problems did you encounter? What alternatives did you try?

##### System and Tools
  * What computer hardware/software environment did you use?
  * Why did you choose this particular environment?

##### Methodology
  * What analysis was performed?
  * What analysis functions/operations did you apply?
  * Why and how did you apply them?

##### Results/Discussion
  * What is/are the outcome(s) of your study?
  * What were the problems you encountered?
  * How does this outcome relate to the research problem?
  * Visual output – maps, images, graphs, etc.

##### Conclusions
A summary of the problem, findings, and implications in a short paragraph.
200 words maximum.

  * How did you interpret the results?
  * What are your recommendations for future action?
